* The Missing FOSS Culture
As you might have noticed, Linux adoption is very low on campus among students and faculty alike!
As a premier Technological Institute, we should have a much, much higher rate of Linux adoption.
* Enter SOS
Society for Open Software (SOS) is a society formed with the purpose of increasing awareness of free and open source software and boost student engagement with the open source community.
