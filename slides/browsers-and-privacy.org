*** Notable Developments
+ Netscape invented Javascript
+ Microsoft invented CSS
*** The Lawsuit
By 1999, IE had 99% of the browser market share. This led to a high-profile anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft.
Later, Netscape open-sourced the code for Netscape Navigator, which then became Firefox.
** Google Chrome (2008)
Google launched its Chrome browser in 2008, and since then it has come to dominate the browser market.

** Newer Browsers
An interesting thing to note is that newer browsers like Opera, Vivaldi, Edge and Brave are also based on Chromium like Chrome. Firefox and Safari are the only two popular browsers not based on Chromium.

* Going One Level Deeper - Why?
** OPSEC
Short for Operation Security. This determines how easy and how likely you are to be discovered.
*** General tips
*** The layers above are as secure as the layers below

*** The more apps/sites you use, the wider your digital footprint
[[./footprint.png]]
** Threat Model
1. What do you need to protect?
2. Who do you need to protect it from?
3. What are your vulnerabilities?
4. What are the risks?
5. What are the countermeasures?

In short: Know /what/ to protect and know /how/ to protect it
