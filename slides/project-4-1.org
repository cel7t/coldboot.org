* A bit about this presentation
We will be covering two papers, [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10109][Generative Agent Simulations of 1000 People]] and the [[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.27.615483v1][oneirogen hypothesis]], with a focus on providing a high-level overview.

* Generative Agent Simulations

* Methodology
- 1052 people of different age, gender, race, ideology
- Test to see how well can agent replicas mimic them

** Economic simulations
More accurate behavioral predictions are better!
** More personalized AI generated content
Ex. Generated e-mails and letters will sound a lot more personal.
** Possible Research Vector
Take the open-source data and test it against problems the individual is skilled at, and compare the performance to a baseline
** Curious Omission
They have not mentioned which LLM they used in the paper - perhaps testing different ones could lead to different results?
* The Oneirogen Hypothesis
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50%

* Key Idea
- Psychedelics are primarily 5-HT2a serotonin receptor agonists
- Wake-Sleep Algorithm that aims to simulate the effects of psychedelics
* What are Psychedelics?

** The Oneirogen Hypothesis
"The perceptual effects of classical psychedelics are a result of
their pharmacological actions inducing neural activity states that truly are more similar to dream-like
states"
** The Method

* Desirable Effects Achieved
Shift enhances replay-dependent learning mechanisms during sleep
** Replay-dependent learning
Replay-dependent learning involves the reactivation of neural patterns associated with past experiences during sleep, facilitating the strengthening of synaptic connections and memory consolidation
* Other Observations
The model captures effects seen in humans:
- Emergence of closed-eye hallucinations
- Increased stimulus-conditioned variabilitiy
- Significant increase in synaptic plasticity
* Implications
